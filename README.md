A mobile app game my twin brother and I was developing in the game engine called Unity. We got the inspiration from the mobile app game called Flappy Bird. This was a personal project of ours through our journey of game development. As of now we're both proficent in Unity, Unreal Engine 4, and Godot. We had taken tutorial courses online through Udemy whiched gave us the knowledge and skills to make better Unity games for mobile and pc. We made it to version 3.2, however the project was discontinued because we were more focused on BCT and school.
